      "descriptiion": "While Coloring Lessons only started back in 2018, the party has grown into one of New York City’s staples within the dance music community. Heavily focused around house, jazz, soul, and everything adjacent; the function spent the past 2 years embracing the musical elements of our black and brown ancestors. Elevated by the radio show & the T-shirt line, Coloring Lessons has come a long way since it’s first party, and now we’re introducing the next addition to the brand, Coloring Lessons Records."
