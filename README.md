## Project Philosophy:

This project was made as a database for me to store music that I have worked on as an audio engineer in once place, as well as to add more music as I am involved in more projects in the future. I was inspired to make this project as an audio engineer in can be hard to keep track of all of the different projects that I have worked on over the year and thought this would be able to create something that I can easily continue to add to as time goes on. 


## Features: 

- The home page displays all of the music projects that I have worked on over the years 
- On the home page you have the ability to like the albums, delete them from the broser, as well as edit the information displayed about them on the page
- Upon clicking on the "edit" button the user will be taken to a form where they can edit information, and then click the "update" button which will automatically link them back to the home page where they can see the changes they made displayed in the browerser
- In the nav bar you can click on the "Add Music" button to add more projects to the home page. Upon clicking you will automatically be taken to a form where you can enter information about the project you are adding. Click on the create button to automatically be linked to the home page and see the new project in the browser. These projects can also be liked, deleted, and edited as desired
- You can also click the about button in the nav bar to be liked to the about page providing information about the developer as well as a link to more projects that they have worked on

## Description of app: 

This is a single page application that is a database of Music projects that Marisa Kimiko Saunders has worked on over the years. It uses a public JSON server to store the data which is then fetched : http://localhost:3004/music

The application uses a total of 6 components: App.js, Home.js, MusicCard.js, Form.js, NavBar.js, and Aout.js

The application has 5 different client-side routes throughout it using React Router: Home, Add, Edit, and About

The application uses GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests in the code.

The GET request is used to fetch the data from the db.json file using the JSON server to display the different projects in the browser. 

The POST request is used in the form in order to add more projects to the home page. The

Two PATCH requests are used in the like feature to add more likes, as well as the update feautre to edit the projects on the home page.

The DELETE request is used to delete projects from the home page. 

Styling was done with css using both styled components and a CSS file, as well as Bootstrap.
